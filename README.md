Supplemental data and cleaning algorithms to the Lai et. al. (2010) inventor-level data
==================

My research benefits greatly from the Lai et. al. (2010) inventor data provided by HBS.  As I have worked with it, I have required new fields, while the data inevitably contains errors.  This repository aims to collect the result of this data collection and cleaning.  Coming soon:

- incorporation dates and filing numbers for plausible new firms in the data
- cleaning file -- in Stata do file -- for pdpass mistakes
- cleaning file -- in Stata do file -- for inventor-level unique id errors
